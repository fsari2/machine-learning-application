# ATMS 523 Weather and Climate Data Analytics 

## Module 8: Individual Final Project - Machine Learning Application

In this module I applied several technique of machine learning that already given by the professor. They include:
- Application of future engineering: label encoder and one-hot-encoder
- Explainble AI by applying `permutation importance`, `future importance`, and `shap`
- Try different model to get the best accuracy

Data for this module retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/23b74415cd4bf90d80ee0066d865c9a11688abaf67d0bed1fe853b1f35c06416/code). This is a weather data for Denpasar location (-8.652497, 115.219117). The data contains several weather variable for period  between 1990 and 2020, yet I, personally, am curious from which tools this data was produced as they have clouds number which usually need a certain equipment (called scintillometter) to calculate the clouds, otherwise it should be manual observation. Meanwhile from this below figure, the location is not one of the listed official AWS owned by Indonesia Agency of Meteorology (BMKG). Otherwise, it could be model data that has been downscalled.
